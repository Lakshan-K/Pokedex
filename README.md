Welcome to my Pokémon Pokedex! Take a nostalgic trip down memory lane with this web application that showcases 350 Pokémon using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Features:
- Browse and explore details of 350 original Pokémon.
- View descriptions and typings for each Pokémon.
- Made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Use:
1. Visit the [Pokémon Pokedex](https://lakshan-k.github.io/Pokemon-Pokedex/pokedex.html) hosted on GitHub Pages.
2. Click on your favorite original Pokémon to see its details, including description and typing.

## Future Plans:
I have plans on how I can make this Pokedex better! Stay tuned for exciting upgrades:
- Additional information about Pokémon abilities, moves, and evolutions.
- Improved user interface for better navigation and interaction.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to making this Pokedex even better!
